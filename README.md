### Hi there 👋

My name is Rafaela Nunes from Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been working as Developer since 2012 and currently I'm Front-End Developer at Engineering Brasil. I'm passionate about computer programming, so I've created this profile to share my projects while learning more, to develop my skills and having fun.

In my free time I like to work out (💪) or dancing (💃🏽), to read books (📚), to watch movies (🎞️) or series (📺) and whenever possible I like to get away (🧳) to know new place and new experiences.

Would you like to find me?
